Developer portfolio website for Molly Felts Vallin

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Stream-of-Consciousness Lessons:
1. to allow for navigation to page sections (no url change), use  react hashlink
2. date information via a js function must be converted to a string if used within a child component
3. React does not like empty .jsx files; name the functions and include 'export default XXX' inside if files are generated before content is added
4. svg logos are nice but difficult manipulate with CSS (re-coloring easier than png)
